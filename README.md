A simple static landing page created using HTML and Tailwindcss

## Description:

- It's the first time ever that I use a CSS framework to style my websites and I'm kinda falling in love with it
- First project using Tailwindcss, yup I know it's nothing too fancy but learning and improving is what really matters
- Inspired from the coding mentor challenge by the name: Bookmark landing page
